# In-Memory Data Processing Challenge

**Course:** Data Processing Techniques  
**Author:** Rithikka A  
**Date:** 16-Oct-2025  

## Objective
Implement an in-memory data processing system to:
- Efficiently process large datasets
- Handle insert, update, and delete operations in real-time
- Compute metrics such as average temperature and humidity
- Demonstrate performance improvement

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Apache Spark / SAP HANA
- In-memory data structures (lists, dicts)

## File Structure

Copy code

## Instructions
1. Run in-memory processing:
```bash
python3 in_memory_processing.py
Observe:

Average temperature and humidity before and after updates

Computation time improvement due to in-memory caching

Observations
Real-time updates without reloading dataset

Incremental analytics update instantly

In-memory processing reduces computation time (~75% improvement)
